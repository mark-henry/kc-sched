- Community that developed is actively improving
- Best optimizes planning problems with the best algorithms known


Bad Features:
- Example implementation of framework is very confusing and looks horrible, but it is just one crude implementation
- Cannot use if just a casual user, have to know how to use Java frameworks


Missing Features:
- Would be nice if it was implemented as a complete package
