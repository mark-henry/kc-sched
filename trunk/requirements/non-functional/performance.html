<p><strong>Section 3.1 System Performance&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>  While our program is  web-based, which if often associated with latency, our goal is to give the user  a very fluid and comfortable experience. Items such as clicking on various  tabs, menu items, and selecting from combo boxes will be effectively instantaneous.  There are some items that may take longer; for instance schedule generation,  while it may not be instantaneous, we do expect it to initialize a schedule for  viewing in under 10 seconds. </p>
<p>  Since our program is  web-based, the end user will not have any data stored locally, and thus the  user should never have any issues with stored data. The database on the web  server should be able to handle thousands of entries for each of our major  components: instructors, courses, and rooms. While these databases may start  small, and restricted to a single department, we must allow for the potential  for departments to merge into a single unified database per school, or even per  school system (such as all of CSU dumping data into a single database). While  this scenario is highly unlikely, our program must allow for such a database on  the webserver.</p>
