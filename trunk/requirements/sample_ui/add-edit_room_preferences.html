<h2>Adding or Editing a Room</h2>
The user clicks the (+) button under the Available Rooms list to open a
dialog to input the information of a new room.<br>
The new room requires a Building Number and Room Number to be added to
the list.&nbsp; More options are available to distinguish the room
including: Capacity, whether the room is a lab or not, how many
computers or stations are available, and a features box where the user
can input what types of boards are in the room and whether there is a
projector, etc.<br>
Once a room has been added to the Available Rooms list, its pertinant
information can be view by just clicking on it in the list.&nbsp;
This
will display all the information on the right hand side of the screen
in the Room Information field. &nbsp;While this information is
displayed any of it can be edited and saved to update that room.
&nbsp;By clicking the (-) button under the list, the selected room
can be removed.<br>
<br>
When adding or editing a room:<br>
<ol>
<li>The Building field must contain only numerical values.</li>
<li>The Room field must contain only numerical values.</li>
<li>The Capacity field must contain only numerical values.</li>
<li>The Lab checkbox may be checked or unchecked.</li>
<li>The Stations field must contain only numerical values and
if there is a nonzero value in it the Lab checkbox will be checked.</li>
<li>The Features field can contain any alphanumeric characters,
with separate items separated by commas.</li>
</ol>
To edit an existing room in the list, the user clicks on a room and
all the related information is filled in. &nbsp;The user can then
edit any of the information and click the "commit changes" button to
save the room with the new information. &nbsp;If the user would
like to cancel any edits made on a room they can click the "restore"
button to revert back to the last saved state.
