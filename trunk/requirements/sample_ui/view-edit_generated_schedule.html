<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">2.2.6.1 Edit
Tab Overview</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Edit tab is where the user
will spend the bulk of their time. Available to admins only, the
tab's primary function is to allow for rearranging and rescheduling
of Sections in the Schedule.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The bulk of the tab's area is
occupied by a grid that displays the Schedule. Each Section is
represented by a small colored square. Each square also has a Pin
button on it, explained further along in this document.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">[Image: general overview of
the Edit tab]</FONT></P>
<P>The horizontal axis is always time. The vertical axis represents
Rooms by default, but the user can change this to Courses or
Instructors by clicking on a series of tabs arranged vertically down
the left-hand side.</P>
<P>[Two images demonstrating the Course and Instructor views]</P>
<P>The Error list pops out of the right-hand side of the tab if there
are Errors to display; otherwise, it is hidden.</P>
<P>To change the scheduling of a Section, the user simply clicks and
drags the Section into a new time slot. To edit the Section, the user
can double-click the Section.</P>
<P>Information for a section is displayed when the cursor is on a
Section. The Course, Instructor, and Room is displayed in this
pop-up.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">2.2.6.2 Refining a Schedule: Pin &amp; Generate</H2>
<P>The Pin &amp; Generate loop is an integral part of the KCSched
tool. Because schedule that is generated by software will rarely be
ideal, the schedule must be refined by the user. The Pin &amp;
Generate method offered by the KCSched tool is an intuitive way to
iteratively improve the Schedule.</P>
<P>First, the user Generates a Schedule (See <A HREF="generate_schedule.html">2.2.5
Generate Schedule</A>). This will take the user to the Edit tab,
where they will discover the inadequacies of the Schedule. However,
some elements of the Schedule will be suitable. The user will then
Pin the sections they find acceptable. Pinned Sections will not be
touched by the Schedule Generator.</P>
<P>Then, the user will run the Schedule Generator again. New
constraints may be put into place on this point. However, even if the
constraints are not changed, the Schedule Generator will scramble the
un-Pinned sections, yielding another Schedule which, hopefully, is
marginally better than the previous one.</P>
<P>The user can then continue to refine and edit until arriving at a
suitable Schedule.</P>
