        <p>
           When the user opens the application, they are presented with a login screen in order to 
           differentiate between instructors and schedulers. The panel on the left displays the name
           of the department as a heading, with text boxes underneath to input the user's credentials.
           The panel on the right displays any notifications issued by the system administrator. The
           remaining space in the center contains a background image configurable by the system 
           administrator.

            A user logs into the system in by entering their username and password into the text boxes, 
            then hitting the enter key. When the scheduler logs in, they will be given access to the interface
            that allows the generation and editing of schedules. An overview of this interface can be found
            in <a href="schedulers.html">Section 2.1.1</a>.

            When an instructor logs in, they will be given a simple interface 
            to edit their preferences and view the most recently published schedule, as well as past
            schedules. An overview of this interface can be found in <a href="instructors.html">Section 2.1.2</a>.
