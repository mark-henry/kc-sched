<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mimosa is an actively supported scheduling software. It is built for the Microsoft operating system, and no alternatives were listed, although it did run well in linux using WINE. While it does not come ready to export to HTML, it can export as a CSV file, which can be imported to many calendar tools.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After using Mimosa for about an hour, I can confidently say that this program is not close to what I expected from a product such as this. Here are some reasons:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Good Features:</b></span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The free trial comes full featured with restrictions on number of classes, and students per class. Additionally, files generated in trial can easily be used in full version if you choose to purchase.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The user is able to optimize over different variables, such as gaps in the teachers schedules, number of classes offered.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Bad Features:</b></span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Non-intuitive navigation menus and drop down bars. After working with the program I am still lost on how to add preferences, availability, and courses for a teacher.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Teachers and rooms are considered “components” to a course, rather than major components of the scheduling algorithm.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Calendar view is cluttered with information, and you cannot easily view a single instructor’s schedule.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Missing features:</b></span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">HTML export.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Easy to view calendar.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Proper navigation menus.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Class room and teacher preferences.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Plug-in capability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Overall Mimosa is not close to what we are looking for in a product, but it gives us an idea of what not to do. If mimosa were to undergo a major revamp of user interface, as well as the ability to add in specific plugins it may stand a better chance, but in the meantime all we can learn from it is what not to do.</span></p>
