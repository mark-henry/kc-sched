1.5.? Meeting Room Management Scheduling Software

While not exactly in the same category of software as our scheduler, Meeting Room Manager can inform our project.

Good Features:

Browser-based; anyone can log in from anywhere.
Clean and intuitive interface
It is possible to make reservations based on available resources, such as whether a room has a projector or whiteboard.
It is possible for the user to add custom metadata for rooms
Any changes are automatically broadcast to all concerned

Bad Features:

None known

Missing Features:

This software was not designed with the exact same purposes in mind as ours, and so does not heuristically generate a schedule based on given guidelines
