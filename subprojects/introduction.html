<h1>Section 1. Introduction </h1>
<p>
This document defines the requirements for the campus wide scheduler 
program at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.  This tool aims at solving the 
traditional problem of scheduling university professors, courses, and 
classrooms in a fast, efficient, and accommodating fashion.  This process 
is currently performed by hand and by a few individuals (per department).  This program will 
allow professors to input "preferences" into the system, and it will allow 
the main scheduler to generate a schedule with the click of a button.  While 
scheduling, the program will take professor preferences into account, and 
will allow for editing afterwards.
