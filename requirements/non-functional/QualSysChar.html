<H3>3.2.  Qualitative System Characteristics</H3>
<P>Security and Privacy:</P>
<P>	The security and privacy of the instructors information is
strictly enforced among all the instructors.  The only users that are
allowed to view any other instructor data are the administrators for
this tool.  Instructors can only edit and view their preferences. 
The login process will only access the instructor's data when logged
in.  Any other data cannot and will not be accessed or modified while
that instructor remains logged in.  If an administrator logs in they
can view all data, the only data they are not allowed to modify is
the instructor preferences.  The instructor are unique and only
accessible by them.  These security features allow for the user's
peace of mind.  If any other user were allowed to modify another
user's data, then that would be a breech of security.  This ensures
that the tool keeps all changes made to each account easy to track.

<P>Usability:</P>
<P>	The design of this tool was tailored for simple interaction. 
Every feature in this tool is labeled for quick and easy
understanding of how to use it.  All tabs and buttons were made to be
intuitive and simple to use.  All messages and warnings are designed
for the user to quickly and easily understand what failed, or what
happened.  The generate tab is simple, its a 1,2,3 step process to
start the generation process once all the other settings are in
place.  The user can simply select what course, instructor and rooms
they wish to include and choose how closely they want the generator
to follow the preferences specified from previous steps.  This allows
the user to quickly and easily generate the schedule once all the
setup work is done.  After the initial setup of the tool subsequent
generations will go faster. 
</P>
<P>	The data tab is also intuitive for the user, if the user wishes
to see what instructors are currently in the list they have access to
they can click on the instructors tab on the left side.  There a list
of instructors is shown and the user can quickly and easily add to it
or remove instructors from it.  If a selection of an instructor was
made, they then can view the details of the instructor.  Same can be
done for the other two tabs (courses and rooms). 
</P>
<P>	The tool itself is designed to be intuitive for the user and easy
to navigate through.  One of the goals of the design was to make
everything easily accessible for the user.  The tabs help to achieve
that goal.  The interface is clean and simple so the user does not
have to search for any implemented functionality.
