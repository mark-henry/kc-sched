<H1>2.4. The Edit Tab</H1>
<HR>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.4.1 The Edit Tab View</H2>
<P>The Edit tab is where the user will spend the bulk of their time.
Available to admins only, the tab's primary function is to allow for
rearranging and rescheduling of Sections in the Schedule.</P>
<P>The bulk of the tab's area is occupied by a grid that displays the
Schedule. The user can pan around the grid by pressing the space bar
and dragging, middle-clicking and dragging, or by using the scroll
bars.</P>
<P>Each Section is represented by a small colored square. Each square
also has a Pin button on it, explained further along in this
document. As the user moves their mouse over the grid, the time block
they are currently hovering over, whether it contains a Section or is
blank, is highlighted with a bold rectangle.</P>
<P>The horizontal axis is always time. As the user moves their mouse
over the grid, the time block the cursor is currently on is displayed
on the horizontal axis.</P>

<P>The vertical axis represents Rooms by default, but the user can
change this to Courses or Instructors by clicking on a series of tabs
arranged vertically down the left-hand side.</P>
<P>[Two images demonstrating the Course and Instructor views]</P>
<P>The Conflict list pops out of the right-hand side of the tab if
there are Conflicts to display; otherwise, it is hidden.</P>
<P>[Image: the Conflict list, popped out, with an Conflict listed]</P>
<P>Information for a section is displayed when the cursor is on a
Section. The Course, Instructor, and Room is displayed in this
pop-up.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">2.4.2 Adding, Editing and Deleting Sections</H2>
<P>To edit a section, the user double-clicks the section's square. To
create a section, the user double-clicks a blank space on the
Schedule. Both these actions bring the user to the Edit Section
screen. When creating a new section, the fields in the Edit Section
screen will be blank; when editing an existing section, the fields
will be populated with the current Section properties.</P>
<P>[Image: the Edit Section screen. It occupies the entire Edit Tab,
and has fields for the four Section properties. These fields are
currently blank]</P>
<P>Here, the user can change all aspects of a Section: the Time,
Instructor, Course and Room.</P>
<P>[Image: the Edit Section screen. Now all fields are filled in with
data]</P>
<P>To save changes, the user clicks the Save button. To cancel
changes without saving, the user clicks the Cancel button.</P>
<P>To delete the Section, the user clicks the Delete This Section button.
After confirming the deletion, the Section will be deleted.</P>
<P>Once Save, Cancel or Delete is selected, the user will be returned
to the main Edit Tab view.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.4.3 Refining a Schedule: Pin &amp; Generate</H2>
<P>The Pin &amp; Generate loop is an integral part of the KCScheduler
tool. Because schedule that is generated by software will rarely be
ideal, the schedule must be refined by the user. The Pin &amp;
Generate method offered by the KCScheduler tool is an intuitive way
to iteratively improve the Schedule.</P>
<P>First, the user Generates a Schedule (see <A HREF="generate_schedule.html">2.2.5
Generate Schedule</A>). This will take the user to the Edit tab,
where they will probably discover some inadequacies in the generated
the Schedule. Hopefully, however, some elements of the Schedule will
be suitable. The user will then Pin the sections they find
acceptable. Pinned Sections will not be touched by the Schedule
Generator.</P>
<P>Then, the user will run the Schedule Generator again. New
constraints may be put into place on this point. However, even if the
constraints are not changed, the Schedule Generator will scramble the
un-Pinned sections, yielding another Schedule which, hopefully, is
marginally better than the previous one.</P>
<P>The user can then continue to refine and edit until arriving at a
suitable Schedule.</P>
