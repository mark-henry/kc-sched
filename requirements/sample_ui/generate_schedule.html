<p>Generate Schedule</p>
<p>This is the current revision of our sample UI scenario when begining schedule generation. The below images show all empty fields, all images are clickable for a larger image. </p>
<p>More descriptions and images are to be added as time progresses, but this should give the user an idea of how items will be added, and what type of data fields they will be prompted with. </p>
<p>The premise is that the user/operator will simply go through the tasks 1-4, and each one builds on the previous. Examples of preferences/conflicts will be added at a later date, for now I imagine a preference would be something such as &quot;attempt to satisfy all teacher preferences first&quot;, or &quot;ignore all teacher preferences&quot;. Conflict resolutions may look something like &quot;in the case of conflict, generate schedule and highlight conflicting courses&quot;, or &quot;in the case of conflict, prompt user before generation&quot;<br>

Vertical bar to the right will show details of conflicts, as well as possible resolutions. Bottom bar is button as well as overall broad status report. Click on image for larger version.</p>

<p>Below are images of filled in data. This does not include the user prompts(to come) as you enter this data.</p>

<p>Image above shows the filled in UI for components of a schedule. As you can see it is intuitive to add or remove a single components, and prompts(to be created later) will allow for easy entry of many components as well.</p>
