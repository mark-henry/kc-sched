1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>
<p>
There are two operational settings for the Scheduling Tool: Primarily to use as a functioning software system; and a secondary use as an example in software engineering courses.
</p>
<p>
The Scheduling tool is intended to be a tool to assist faculty and professors who handle the course scheduling in their department. It must operate in a way that minimizes the hassle for the creation of the schedules as well as make it easy to relay the schedule info to the scheduling department on campus.
</p>
<p>
As noted in the preceding section on system personnel, there is a single primary customer for the Scheduling Tool, and he is representative of customers in a particular university department.  As such, the tool's requirements reflect the point of view of the customer base, including their work setting. Given the intent to develop a general-purpose product, we will be making an effort to include as many features as possible while keeping the product simple.
</p>
<p>
The Scheduling Tool has been designed to fit the curriculum used by Gene Fisher in undergraduate and graduate software engineering courses at Cal Poly University.  These courses are two-quarter sequences that cover standard aspects of software engineering, with emphasis on the practical application of formal methods.  For the most part, the concepts covered in these courses, and hence the concepts embodied in the Scheduling Tool, are mainstream software engineering.  Other instructors may therefore find the Scheduling Tool and its development artifacts useful as course examples.
