2.6.  Details of File Commands
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The scenarios in this section cover full details of file-related commands.
</p>



<a name="New and Open">
<h4>
2.6.1.  New and Open
</h4>
</a>
<p>
When the user executes the ''<tt>New</tt>' command in the `<tt>File</tt>' menu,
the system responds by creating a new Schedule and displaying its initial view.
</p>
<p>
When the user selects the '<tt>Open</tt>' command in the `<tt>File</tt> menu, the user may type the name of the file to open or select it from the scrollable
list of file names. 

<a name='Save and Save As'>
<h4>
2.6.2. Save and Save As
</h4>
</a>
<p>
	When the user selects the 'Save' in the 'File' menu, the Schedule will be automatically saved to its specified file. If the file is new and unsaved, a dialog will appear asking the user where to save the file. Selecting 'Save As' has the same effect as clicking 'Save' for the first time.
</p>

<a name='Export'>
<h4>
2.6.3. Export
</h4>
</a>
<p>
	When the user selects 'Export' in the 'File' menu, the Export tab in the program will be displayed, giving options for the user to export to file.
</p>

	
<a name="Print">
<h4>
2.6.4. Print
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Printing from the Scheduling Tool is based strictly on the content visible in
active Scheduling Tool windows.  Window content appears on the printed page
exactly as it appears on the screen.
